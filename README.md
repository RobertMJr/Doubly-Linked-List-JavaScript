# Linked Lists [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. 

### [Doubly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list)
* In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes.
* Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.
* The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator.
